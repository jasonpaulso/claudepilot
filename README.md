# Claude Pilot
A Claude Code terminal view for VS Code that can be moved to different VS Code regions.

## Features

- **Moveable Terminal**: Drag and drop the Claude terminal between the primary sidebar, secondary sidebar, and bottom panel
- **Persistent Sessions**: Terminal sessions persist between VS Code restarts
- **Activity Bar Integration**: Quick access via the robot icon in the Activity Bar
- **Status Bar Button**: Launch Claude from the status bar
- **Editor Integration**: Access Claude via the editor toolbar
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Drop files and text directly into the terminal

## Usage

1. Click the robot icon in the Activity Bar to open Claude Pilot
2. Drag the panel to your preferred location (sidebar, secondary sidebar, or bottom panel)
3. Use the terminal just like the built-in Claude Code terminal
4. Sessions persist automatically between VS Code sessions

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.74.0 or higher
- [Claude Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Anthropic.claude-code) by Anthropic
- Claude Code CLI installed and available in your `PATH`

## Installation

Install from the VS Code Marketplace or install the `.vsix` file directly.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome on GitHub.

### Known Issues & Future Work
- **Terminal state persistence**: When the Claude Pilot view is closed and reopened, the terminal appears blank until user interaction (though the underlying PTY session persists). A visual redraw mechanism is needed to restore the display state.
- **Cursor positioning**: Cursor may appear offset from correct position after resizing terminal. Force resize to redraw fixes it temporarily.
